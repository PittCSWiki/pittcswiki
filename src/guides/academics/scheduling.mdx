Let's look at the core CS classes required for the major. It
might look intimadating at first, but it just shows the requirements
of classes. For example, to take CS 1501, you must take CS 441 and CS 445.

The dashed lines mean those classes are "coreqs". For example, you can take CS 449 if you are taking CS 447 in the semester. But, you cannot take
CS 449 before CS 447.

## Overview

The core courses can be broken up into different tracks.

**Core Programming Intensive**

These classes teach the most fundamental CS concepts. **Bolded classes** are considered very demanding. 

- CMP 401
- CS 445
- **CS 1501**

**Mathy**

These are more theory based classes that involve proofs and math.

- CS 441
- CS 1502

**Systems**

Do you actually know how a computer works? These classes will teach you!

- CS 447
- **CS 449**
- **CS 1550**

## Potential Schedules

We recommend taking CS445 and CS1501 as soon as possible. These courses form the foundation of your CS education and will unlock a lot of upper electives. They also are an absolute necessity for technical interviews. 

Making a Good CS Plan

1. Take 401, 445, and 1501 early on
2. Decide which semester you will take 1501.
3. Throw away the plan (in college, things change!)

Below are some potential schedules. Your schedule will look different depending on your other classes!

Whenever you schedule a class make sure to **play close attention to the professor**. It's better to optimize your schedule
to have better professors good. Check the respective pages for each course on the wiki and use Rate My Professor.

**Note:** These **are just example schedules**. Everyone's situation is different and yours will likely look different.

## What should I take with these CS classes?

It depends on the rigor of the CS course, and the professor. Notably, if we are talking about CS 1501, we would not want a heavy course load. We recommend not taking Calculus II with CS1501/CS1550 as they are very demanding. Instead, take Calc with a lower level required course like 401 or 449 or take it with your upper electives!

We would likely take some light gen-eds with CS 1501 or CS 1550. As noted, they are demanding and you wouldn't want other tough classes from interfering with them.

## CS Electives

You discover your interests in CS as you take some electives. You’re not limited to take classes in a certain domain, but try to take classes that you'll enjoy. Electives are meant to cover topics you want to explore, not classes you suffer in. For example, if you didn’t enjoy CS 447, 449, or 1550 you probably don’t want to take Computer Architecture or other low level courses. On the other hand, if you enjoy certain parts of CS 1501, such as the introduction to cryptography section, CS 1653 would probably be a good elective to take.

Check out the [course explorer](/courses) to look at the different electives that are offered. Pick the ones that pique your interest.

## FAQ

### CS 007 or CS 401?

If you have never programmed before, take CS 007. If you have experience programmed, take 401. If you have AP Computer Science credit, definitely skip 401.

### Should I Graduate Early?

If you have enough credits, you can graduate early! It is a great way to save some tuition money. But, there are also some more classes that can help you as a CS major.

It really depends on what your interests are. For example, if you are interested in Data Science, we would recommend taking some Statistics classes. In particular, STAT 1261, and STAT 1201 would be excellent options.

If you are interested in Cryptography, we would recommend taking some Math classes. In particular, Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography, Elementary Number Theory, Combinatorial Mathematics, would be great options. Note that all these classes require MATH 413.

If you're interested in writing/improving your communication and expression skills, the Creative Writing minor is a great choice!
