## Introduction

The Capstone Experience is a mandatory part of every CS student's graduation requirements at Pitt. In this article, we'll go over the possible options you have for completing this requirement, and more importantly *how to complete the capstone you want*. 

You'll see that the steps to completing your capstone are pretty tricky/unclear to navigate, so that's why we made this guide.

## Capstone Options

1. CS 1900 - Internship
2. CS 1906 (Formerly ENGR 1093) - Co-Op
2. CS 1950 - Directed Research
3. CS 1980 - Capstone Project


## CS 1900 - Internship

First things first, let's go over the most commonly used Capstone course.  
 
**In order to qualify as eligible to enroll in the CS 1900 Capstone Course, you must be a declared CS major - this requires you to have a C or better in all 0400-level classes - CS 0401, CS 0441, CS 0445, CS 0447, and CS 0449. Additionally, you'll need to have Junior academic standing (at least 60 credits completed).**

Here's the description of what kind of position qualifies as eligible for CS 1900.

*Obtain a relevant technical job / internship from a legitimate employer. The job may be full-time or part-time (minimum 10 hours / week; 12 or more weeks) and it may or may not be for pay. The work should directly involve skills / abilities that were either learned in CS courses or that otherwise relate directly to the CS degree. Examples include software development, software testing, database administration, network administration and other jobs. If you are unsure whether a potential job will qualify for a CS academic internship or not, see John Ramirez to discuss the job prior to accepting it. For assistance in finding a job you may consult with Career Services.*

So you've got a position like this locked up. Congratulations! What now?

You need to do two things:

1. Secure a faculty sponsor
2. Get someone from your company to fill out the employer form (more on this in a sec)

### Faculty Sponsor ###
This can be any full-time professor in the CS department. *You don't need to know them exceptionally well to ask them to be your faculty sponsor - they've been asked many times and are aware of how little (if any) work it takes to be your faculty sponsor.* The entire faculty sponsor part of this process is a pretty inactive  rule that is rarely followed up on once they sign off on that
