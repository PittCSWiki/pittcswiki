Here is a collection more of random advice!

- APPLY EARLY AND APPLY EVERYWHERE
- When emailing recruiters, always reply to an email they sent you instead of composing a new message to them. This increases the chances of you getting a reply back.
- Ask people for advice. People are willing to help you, if you ask for it.
- Keep an open mind - there are a lot of examples of people who ended up really loving a company they did not even know existed.
- Try to ask for what you want, it does not hurt to ask. For example, if you have an interview scheduled on a Wednesday in a city and you want to move it to a Friday so you can spend the weekend, try asking your recruiter!
- Fall and spring internships are possible! Sometimes doing a fall internship is a great break from school and a great way to get new, varied experience. Ask your recruiter!
- Companies are mean to freshmen. There are freshmen only programs.
- You might hear the term “Big N” and “FAANG” tossed around. This refers to the top tech companies. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. Do not forget, there are so many great companies to work at beyond these!
- Seek out opportunities!
- If you go to college you are lucky!
- There are a lot of profressors that can use your help if you are willing to help them and can sell yourself.
- Go to your school’s CS club events
