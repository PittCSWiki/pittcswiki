title: "[02O] 7. Technical Interview Questions"
---

> This is a part of a series of guides called Zero to Offer aimed to help you navigate the internship process. We recommend you start [here](/zero-to-offer/)!

In addition to being able to solve coding problems, you will likely be asked technical questions from one or more topics. 
The following are a list of these topics and their components you may encounter when interviewing for an internship or full time position.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert in all of these topics, but a good understanding of the fundamentals will serve you well.
In general, the depth of these interview questions will not require more than a one minute answer.

## Programming Concepts

### Data Structures and Algorithms
It is very likely you will be asked a question regarding basic data structures and their correpsonding algorithms.
This information can be found in CS0445 and CS1501 curricula.

Understand the difference between the following data structures.
Be able to explain differences in search/sort/search runtimes and their implementation details.
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Trees [Binary, B/B+]
- Graphs
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table

Note, you will want to use Big(O) to describe their space and time complexity requirements.

### Programming Languages
- Be able to explain the difference between a compiled and an interpreted language.
- Be able to explain situations where one language may be better than an other. This can be a more personal/subjective question.
- Understand what Imperative Programming means
  - Procedural
  - Object Oriented

### Object Oriented Programming
-Be able to explain what object oriented programming is, and why it is useful.
-Be able to explain the foundations of OOP
  -Encapsulation
  -Abstraction
  -Inheritance
  -Polymorphism
