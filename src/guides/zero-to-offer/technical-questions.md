In addition to being able to solve coding problems, you will likely be asked several technical questions from one or more topics. 
The following are a list of topics and related questions you may encounter when interviewing for an internship or full time position.
You do not necessarily have to be an expert in all of these topics, but a good understanding of the fundamentals will serve you well.
In general, the depth of these interview questions will not require more than a one minute answer.
